React.js Bucket

React.js may be defined as a "declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces... It lets you compose complex user interfaces (UIs) from small and isolated pieces of code called components." (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-are-we-building)
